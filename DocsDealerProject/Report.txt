At the end of the last phase of this project we were able to read our old data
files for our company from JSON as well as the new data files for our new dealerships
that were saved in XML. We were able to write all of that data to the old data format in
JSON. However, we were, at that time, unable to save data for dealerships with no
vehicles in them. We also had allowed for the ability to manually add vehicles, the
ability of transferring vehicles between dealerships, the marking of vehicles as rented,
the creation of new dealerships, and the removal of vehicles from dealerships.

In this phase of the project, we worked on refactoring our domain and data access
files to be written in the Kotlin programming language. We also fixed the error of
not being able to save data for dealerships with no inventory. We also reimplemented
the ability to manually save data to a file at managementâ€™s request. In addition, we
added a new feature that allows for bad data to be corrected in the program and added to
the company. We believe that this feature will be useful as it allows for any files with bad
data to be corrected directly instead of needing to be completely re-added manually.
